//Static list vs live list

// if we add/create ele by 

//1.document.querySelector---->then it will give us static list
//2.document.getElementBy[something]----> then it will give us live list

//means in both ways we can select the html collections and create new tags 
// but in  method 2 it is added to html collection while in method 1 it is not

//we prefer generally 1 but 2 can be useful in some place
