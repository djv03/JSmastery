//yeahhh!!! we have reached to events
//which is probably most crucial part of my JS mastrey journey
//coz it has all the things which I am thinking of implimenting

//So, Lets get started
//event: event is JS is same as in english...to do something
//JS offers lots of events like click.hover,mouse in, mouse out

//but we strat with most basic events

//lets say we want to see something while we click on the button

let btn= document.querySelector(".go-live");//select the ele

btn.addEventListener("click", function(){
    console.log("button is clicked");
})

// btn.addEventListener("[eventname]", function we want to perform by it)
